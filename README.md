<p align="justify">Back-End Developer with a degree in Systems Analysis and Development.
It all started when I was 13, using Python — or maybe I should go further back? Actually, it all began when I decided to have some fun making games and creating weird little worlds using RGSS in RPG Maker.
My passion for computers is obvious. Games? Yeah, that’s not very exciting to talk about. I can tell you more than that — I love to drink coffee, and I adore my cat, Suse. Yes, her name is inspired by OpenSUSE. 
<br>
I definitely want to keep studying. My next goal is a degree in Computer Science. PhD? Of course — I just don’t know which field I want to dive into yet. Maybe life will show me the way</a>.</p>
